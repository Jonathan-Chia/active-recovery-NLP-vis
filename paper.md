# Visualizations of LLM Output - Active Recovery Protocols

*Jonathan Chia - Data Visualizations Class @ Johns Hopkins - 7/19/2025*

## Introduction

As a workaholic, I have burned out multiple times in my life. My worst burnout lasted for an entire summer. I had absolutely no energy or motivation, so I lounged around a whole summer playing videogames and eating food. 

One day, while scrolling through Youtube, I came across a video titled [Clearing Your Allostatic Load Make Laziness Impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNKhJtQpboU&t=492s) by Rian Doris, a cofounder of the Flow Research Collective. The video talked about using active recovery to never burnout again. 

Applying the active recovery protocols changed my life. I started doing cold plunges, sauna, sleeping better, exercising more, and since then, I haven't burned out and my output has increased. 

This project aims to visualize some of the text outputs from DeepSeek about the 6 main active recovery protocols:

* Breathwork
* Cryotherapy
* Exercise
* Heat Therapy
* Nature Immersion
* Sleeping

## Analysis
Explain the data and results of your text or NLP analysis. Clearly explain
the different analysis that you performed, libraries used, and show some of the
results such as word frequencies, correlations, length, etc…. Please feel free to
include tables, summaries, etc…


## Visualization of Text Analysis
include screenshots of five visualization techniques
and explain what they show, the kind of interaction users have, and justify why
they are relevant to your analysis.

## Conclusion
