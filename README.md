# active-recovery-NLP-vis
NLP Visualization practice on some DeepSeek generated answers about Active Recovery. 


## Plan

Let's get 6 different docs each focused on a specific active recovery protocol.

We can also do some summarization of the 6 docs into one summary. 

One fun visualization would be to take the embedding of each doc and make a heat map of how similar the active recovery protocols are. 

We need to do some summarization / leverage chatgpt to find overlapping benefits. Then, we can look for those benefits in each of the 6 documents.

From there, I can build that cool star chart.
